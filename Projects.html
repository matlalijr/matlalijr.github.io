        <p class="project-desc">
The aim of this project was to design a controller for regulating the altitude of a helicopter simulation. A controller was designed to manage the altitude of a specific helicopter simulation based on client-defined requirements. The Lead Compensator was developed based on the results derived from the transfer function of the controller block, which was obtained using MATLAB's SISO tool. Consequently, the transfer function inputted into the controller block was selected to ensure that the closed-loop performance of the system met all requirements through the application of the phase Lead Compensator.

        <h2 class="project-title">Multivariable Control of a Thermal System in Laboratory Environment (Final Year Project)</h2>
        <p class="project-desc">
In this project, the aim was to compare the performance of three different controllers—PID, State Space, and SMC—as they were applied to a multivariable system. The project involved designing and digitally implementing the three controllers on a physical system in the control lab. To ensure fairness in the comparison, it was ensured that each controller achieved similar performance levels. This involved comparing factors such as the computational cost of implementation and the magnitude of control inputs required to achieve comparable performance across the different controllers.

Implementing two compression schemes, namely the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) compression and the Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) Compression, was carried out. The aim was to compare their performance on various signals using different metrics.

        <p class="project-desc">
I developed an image recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Python (Jupyter Notebook). This involved building and training a CNN model using TensorFlow. The process included preprocessing image data, defining and configuring the CNN architecture, training the model on labeled image datasets, and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss. The trained model was then capable of accurately classifying or recognizing objects within images.

        <p class="project-desc">
The focal point of this project involved constructing a mobile two-wheeled robot with the capability to navigate and solve a maze utilizing a line sensing algorithm. To execute the maze-solving objective, a team of two Mechatronics students were equipped with a pre-assembled line sensing DFRobot Turtle 2WD Mobile Platform robot controlled by an Arduino RoMeo V2 microcontroller. Their assignment was to utilize MATLAB, alongside Simulink and Arduino support from Simulink, to devise functions enabling the robot to familiarize itself with the maze. Once acclimated to the maze layout, the robot would refine its movement strategy and successfully navigate the maze to its conclusion.

    <p class="project-desc">
      In this project, I was tasked to simulate a warehouse organizational robot responsible for moving packages to different locations in the facility. The robot had two links and could move along a rail to facilitate this functionality. The robot’s end-effector had suction cups and a sensor that can detect when the arm is sufficiently close to a desired package. The package was held stationary by another system until the robot confirms it has successfully grabbed the package.
