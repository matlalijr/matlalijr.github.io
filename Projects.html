          <b>Helicopter Altitude Control:</b> The aim of this project was to
          design a controller for regulating the altitude of a helicopter
          simulation. A controller was designed to manage the altitude of a
          specific helicopter simulation based on client-defined requirements.
          The Lead Compensator was developed based on the results derived from
          the transfer function of the controller block, which was obtained
          using MATLAB's SISO tool. Consequently, the transfer function inputted
          into the controller block was selected to ensure that the closed-loop
          performance of the system met all requirements through the application
          of the phase Lead Compensator.

            >Multivariable Control of a Thermal System in Laboratory
            Environment(FINAL YEAR PROJECT):</b
          >
          In this project, the aim was to compare the performance of three
          different controllers—PID, State Space, and SMC—as they were applied
          to a multivariable system. The project involved designing and
          digitally implementing the three controllers on a physical system in
          the control lab. To ensure fairness in the comparison, it was ensured
          that each controller achieved similar performance levels. This
          involved comparing factors such as the computational cost of
          implementation and the magnitude of control inputs required to achieve
          comparable performance across the different controllers.

          <b>Digital Signal Processing Project:</b> Implementing two compression
          schemes, namely the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) compression and
          the Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) Compression,
          was carried out. The aim was to compare their performance on various
          signals using different metrics.(Photo was acquired from

          <b>Image Recognition using Machine Learning:</b>I developed an image
          recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in
          Python(Jupyter Notebook). This involved building and training a CNN
          model using TensorFlow. The process included preprocessing image data,
          defining and configuring the CNN architecture, training the model on
          labeled image datasets, and evaluating its performance using metrics
          such as accuracy and loss. The trained model was then capable of
          accurately classifying or recognizing objects within images.(Photo was
          acquired from viso.ai)

          <b>Line following Robot:</b> The focal point of this project involved
          constructing a mobile two-wheeled robot with the capability to
          navigate and solve a maze utilizing a line sensing algorithm. To
          execute the maze-solving objective, a team of two Mechatronics
          students were equipped with a pre-assembled line sensing DFRobot
          Turtle 2WD Mobile Platform robot controlled by an Arduino RoMeo V2
          microcontroller. Their assignment was to utilize MATLAB, alongside
          Simulink and Arduino support from Simulink, to devise functions
          enabling the robot to familiarize itself with the maze. Once
          acclimated to the maze layout, the robot would refine its movement
          strategy and successfully navigate the maze to its conclusion.

          <b>2D Manipulator(Warehouse organizational robot) Simulation:</b>
          In this project, I was tasked to simulate a warehouse organizational
          robot responsible for moving packages to different locations in the
          facility. The robot had two links and could move along a rail to
          facilitate this functionality.The robot’s end-effector had suction
          cups and a sensor that can detect when the arm is sufficiently close
          to a desired package. The package was held stationary by another
          system until the robot confirms it has successfully grabbed the
          package.
