          <b>Helicopter Altitude Control:</b> The objective of this project was
          to develop a controller capable of regulating the altitude of a
          helicopter simulation. The full project report can be found here

            >Multivariable Control of a Thermal System in Laboratory
            Environment:</b
          >
          In this project, the aim was to compare the performance of three
          different controllers—PID, State Space, and SMC—as they were applied
          to a multivariable system. The project involved designing and
          digitally implementing the three controllers on a physical system in
          the control lab. To ensure fairness in the comparison, it was ensured
          that each controller achieved similar performance levels. This
          involved comparing factors such as the computational cost of
          implementation and the magnitude of control inputs required to achieve
          comparable performance across the different controllers.

          <b>Digital Signal Processing Project:</b> Implementing two compression
          schemes, namely the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) compression and
          the Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) Compression,
          was carried out. The aim was to compare their performance on various
          signals using different metrics.(Photo was acquired from
          xposuremusic.com)

          <b>Image Recognition using Machine Learning:</b>I developed an image
          recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in
          Python(Jupyter Notebook). This involved building and training a CNN
          model using TensorFlow. The process included preprocessing image data,
          defining and configuring the CNN architecture, training the model on
          labeled image datasets, and evaluating its performance using metrics
          such as accuracy and loss. The trained model was then capable of
          accurately classifying or recognizing objects within images.(Photo was
          acquired from viso.ai)

          <b>2D Manipulator(Warehouse organizational robot) Simulation:</b>
          In this project, I was tasked to simulate a warehouse organizational
          robot responsible for moving packages to different locations in the
          facility. The robot had two links and could move along a rail to
          facilitate this functionality.The robot’s end-effector had suction
          cups and a sensor that can detect when the arm is sufficiently close
          to a desired package. The package was held stationary by another
          system until the robot confirms it has successfully grabbed the
          package.
